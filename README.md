For this project I am putting the data of monthly rainfall in a few countries onto a line graph. The name of the countries will be on the right side of the graph and they can be click on to add the data onto the graph. The names can be click on again to take that data off.

The data was gathered from Climate Change Knowledge Portal: http://sdwebx.worldbank.org/climateportal/index.cfm?page=country_historical_climate
